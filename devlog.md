Devlog for Eitan-GO by Gary Vincent

Friday June 20th 2025:
    What I Worked On: Today I installed Node and Tailwind and pushed the initial project shell to the git repository. I then built the WordInput function, learned how to use lift state in React, rendered dynamic content using useState and ternary logic.

    What I Struggled With: I forgot to pass a prop and got a runtime error. Troubleshooting this helped me understand how state and props connect beweeen components. 

    What I Learned: I learned lots today, as it was the first time setting up a react project. Some highlights include an introduction to Tailwind styling, reinforsing JSX incertion syntax, and state and prop connectivity.

    What's Next: Tomorrow I plan to integrate OpenAI API to generate example sentences based on user input.
